# Global-Terrorism
The Global Terrorism Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project aims to analyze and visualize data related to global terrorism incidents. Through statistical and graphical methods, this project seeks to identify patterns, trends, and insights within the dataset. Key aspects include exploring geographical hotspots, understanding attack methods, assessing the impact on different regions, and potentially uncovering factors contributing to terrorism. The EDA process will provide a comprehensive overview of the global terrorism landscape, facilitating a better understanding of the phenomenon for policymakers, researchers, and the general public.
